 ## App Exercise - Guard
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 In the exercises on optionals, you created a failable initializer for a `Workout` struct that would only initialize a `Workout` object if the `startTime` and `endTime` were further apart than 10 seconds. You'll now create the same failable initializer, only using a guard statement to check that the start and end times aren't too close together.
 
 Create a `Workout` struct that has properties `startTime` and `endTime` of type `Double`. Dates are difficult to work with, so you'll be using doubles to represent the number of seconds since midnight, i.e. 28800 would represent 28,800 seconds, which is exactly 8 hours, so the time would be 8am.
 
 Write a failable initializer that takes parameters for your start and end times, and then checks to see if they are greater than 10 seconds apart using a guard statement. If they are, your initializer should fail. Otherwise, the initializer should set the properties accordingly.
 */
struct Workout {
    let startTime: Double       // represented as number of seconds since midnight
    let endTime: Double         // represented as numebr of seconds since midnight
    
    init?(start t_start: Double, end t_end: Double){
        // Guard condition to check that the two times are at least 10 seconds apart
        guard (t_end - t_start > 10) else {
            return nil
        }
        
        // If the two times are 10 seconds apart, initialize
        startTime = t_start
        endTime = t_end
    }
}

let newWorkout = Workout(start: 1, end: 100)
print(newWorkout!)
let notAWorkout = Workout(start: 1, end: 8)
print(notAWorkout)

/*:
 Imagine a screen where a user inputs a meal that they've eaten. If the user taps a "save" button without adding any food, you might want to prompt the user that they haven't actually added anything.
 
 Using the `Food` struct and the text fields provided below, create a function called `logFood` that takes no parameters and returns an optional `Food` object. Inside the body of the function, use a guard statement to unwrap the `text` property of `foodTextField` and `caloriesTextField`. In addition to unwrapping `caloriesTextField`, you'll need to create and unwrap a new variable that initializes an `Int` from the text in `caloriesTextField`. If any of this fails, return `nil`. After the guard statement, create and return a `Food` object.
 */
struct Food {
    var name: String
    var calories: Int
}

let foodTextField = UITextField()
let caloriesTextField = UITextField()

foodTextField.text = "Banana"
caloriesTextField.text = "23"

func logFood() -> Food? {
    // Guard 1 - Unwrap the text field inputs as Strings
    guard let foodText = foodTextField.text, let caloriesText = caloriesTextField.text else { return nil }
    
    print(foodText)
    print(caloriesText)
    
    // Guard 2 - Storing the caloriesText as an Int
    guard let calories = Int(caloriesText) else {
        print("Cannot read calories as an integer.")
        return nil
    }
    
    // If both guard conditions cleared, instantiate a new object and return it
    let newFood = Food(name: foodText, calories: calories)
    return newFood
}
/*:
 Call the function you made above and capture the return value. Unwrap the `Food` object with standard optional binding and print a statement about the food using each of its properties. Go back and change the text in `caloriesTextField` to a string that cannot be converted into a number. What happens in that case?
 */
if let newFood = logFood() {
    print("The name of the food is \(newFood.name) and its calories are \(newFood.calories).")
} else {
    print("The food was not instantiated properly. Try logging again.")
