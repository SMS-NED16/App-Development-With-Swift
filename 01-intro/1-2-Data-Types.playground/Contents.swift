// Type safety in Swift
let playerName = "Julian"       // inferred String
var playerScore = 1000          // inferred int
var gameOver = false            // inferred Bool

// Type Inference
let cityName = "San Francisco"
// "San Francisco" is obviously a `String`, so the compiler automatically assigns the type of cityName to a `String`

let pi = 3.1415927
// This is a number with decimal points, so the compiler automatically assigns the type `pi` to a `Double`

// Explicitly specifying the type of a variable/constant
let explicitCityName: String = "San Francisco"
let explicitPi: Double = 3.1415927

// When we use type annotation, Swift will automatically cast the literal to the appropriate data type if possible
let number: Double = 3
print(number)               // 3.0

// Common use cases for type annotation
// Created a variable but haven't assigned it a value
let firstName: String;

// Create a constant or variable that could be inferred as more than one type
let middleInitial: Character = "J"
// this could be interpreted as a String or a Char

var remainingDistance: Float = 30
// `30` would be inferred as an `Int` but the variable shoudl support decimal numbers for accuracy as the number decreases

// When we write our own type definition
struct Car {
    var make: String
    var model: String
    var year: Int
}

// Required values
// Must either specify value or use type annotation
// var x           // this will cause an error - no value to infer type from, and no annotation

// Even if the variable has been declared with a type, it will cause an error if accessed without assigning a value to it
var x2: Int
print(x2)

// Once the value is assigned, the constant/variable becomes available
var x3: Int
x3 = 10
print(x3)
